In 1999, Ravikant co-founded consumer product review site Epinions. They raised $45 million in venture capital from investors, including Benchmark Capital and August Capital. In 2003, Epinions merged with comparison pricing site Dealtime with the approval of Ravikant and the other co-founders that had left the company—even though it meant valuing their shares at zero.[7]

The merged company became Shopping.com which held an Initial public offering (IPO) in October 2004. In January 2005, Ravikant and three of his co-founders filed a lawsuit against Benchmark, August Capital, their co-founder Nirav Tolia who remained at Epinions after his co-founders' departures claiming that—to get their approval for the merger—they were misled to believe that at the time of the merger, the company was worth "$23 million to $38 million", less than the $45 million that they had raised in outside capital, making their shares worthless.[7] The lawsuit was settled in December 2005.
